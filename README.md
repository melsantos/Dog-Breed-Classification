# Dog Breed Classification
A CNN capable of inferencing up to 120 dog breeds

## Overview
Compare the training times of various machine learning frameworks and their performance on different devices. For this project we will being using TensorFlow and Keras and comparing their execution times on CPU and GPU.

## Analysis
For this analysis, we trained our model only the top 8 dog breeds of our dataset. We used the same CNN architecture in both framework implementations. We used a Jupyter Notebook and ran it in Google Colab.

Unsuprisingly, the models completed training on the GPU much faster than CPU. For a more detail analysis check [here](https://github.com/melsantos/Dog-Breed-Classification/blob/master/report.pdf "Project Report")
